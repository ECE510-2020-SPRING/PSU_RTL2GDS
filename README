#########################################################
For selecting the design type to do your synth or ICC2 or PT runs on,
you can type "f" for fifo1
you can type "e" for RiscV ExampleRocketSystem.
you can type "o" for ORCA_TOP.  
    For ORCA_TOP, the current RTL does not have macros, but the input to ICC2 does have macros.
    I have only run dc_shell with RTL.  Otherwise, I have always run ICC2.
That will change the design_top variable through an alias set up in .synopsys*.setup in your current work directory.

Only fifo1_sram is tested in Genus/Innovus currently.
    Power grid on M1/M2 could be improved in Innovus to improve routing.

# Decoder ring for the libraries
# You will need to follow another example or look in the library directories to understand.

# lib_types is used for the dc/dct linking variables and ICC2 NDM lcoations.

# link_library, Target_library use the sub_lib_types and corner variables. 
# For sub_lib_types and corner:
# Example:
#     saed32hvt_ss0p75v125c.db
#     |sub_lib  corner    .db
# The current flow tries to find all sub_lib and all corners in all the search paths.  Any match will be put in the library list.
# Wild cards can be used, but be careful.  Multiple matches can occur in ways you don't want.

# For the target library, the same method is used as the link library except only HVT and RVT lib_types are used.

# ICC2 NDM choosing also uses the sub_lib_types so that only the required libraries and extras are not loaded.
